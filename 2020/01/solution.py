    Find and return a tuple of `k` elements from `numbers` that their sum equals to `d`. If no such
    tuple exists, `None` is returned.

    Note: Given that item search in `numbers` is performed in complexity `O(1)` the overall
    complexity of this function is `O(n^(k-1))` where `n = |numbers|`.

    @param numbers - A set of integers from which to chose the tuple.

    @param k - Number of elements in the desired tuple. Must be a positive integer.

    @returns A tuple of numbers `T` such that: `T âŠ† numbers`, `|T| = k` and `sum(T) = d`.
